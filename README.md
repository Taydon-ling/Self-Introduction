# Self-Introduction
##This is an introduction about myself.

My name is Taydon Ling Guang Jun. 18 years old.
I'm from Malaysia. It's a country with lots of races, and because of that, there are a lot of delicious local food you can try.
My favourite sport is badminton. I won a badminton competition before.
